# CocosSharp v1.5.0.0 release notes

## Key new features
 ---

### Unified PCL NuGet

We have removed the confusion of offering multiple NuGet packages for each distinct platform. Instead, from this release onwards we will simply provide a single PCL NuGet &mdash; namely, __CococsSharp.PCL.Shared.nupkg__, which, aside from other PCL's, can be referenced within the following platform-specific projects:

*  iOS
*  Android
*  Windows DX
*  Windows 8
*  Windows Phone 8.1
*  Windows Phone 8.0 



__Note__: If you're migrating from an existing CocosSharp project that references a platform-specific NuGet (e.g. CocosSharp.iOS.1.4.0.0.nupkg), then you'll need to explicitly remove the old package and then subsequently add CococsSharp.PCL.Shared.1.5.0.0.nupkg.


### Renderer pipeline

We have overhauled the way CocosSharp performs rendering, with a focus on improved performance. Please check out this article [here](link_to_forum_post) for an in-depth discussion on the design of our renderer pipeline and what it means for developers.

### Templates

Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio (VS) templates have been updated with the latest PCL package for this release. In particular, we now have VS project templates for:

* Windows Phone 8.1
* Mobile
  * Portable (PCL) - Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8.1
  * Shared project - Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8.1

Details on how to access project templates for Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio can be found [here](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/26822/cocossharp-project-templates-for-xamarin-studio) and [here](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/30701/cocossharp-project-templates-for-visual-studio) respectively.

## Breaking changes
 ---

* Unfortunately, while offering a single unified PCL package simplify things greatly, there are some technical limitations and trade-offs. Specifically, our offering is currently unable to target __classic Mac and Windows GL projects__. However, in the future, CocosSharp packages will support Unified Mac projects so please keep that in mind.


* Due to the inclusion of the new renderer pipeline, __<code>CCSpriteBatchNode</code> has been marked obsolete__, however to avoid confusion will be omitted entirely in future releases. Please see the article [here](link_to_forum_post) for details on how to migrate away from this class.


* __<code>CCRenderTexture</code> is longer derived from <code>CCNode</code>__. Previously, <code>CCRenderTexture</code> served a dual role where it could both be attached to the scene-graph or used externally, with the corresponding <code>Sprite</code> instead added to a scene. For example

<pre>
<code>
CCRender renderTexture;
CCSprite renderTexSprite;

// Initialise render texture

renderTexture.Begin();
// Draw into texture
renderTexture.End();

// Previously, could add texture to a parent node
parentNode.AddChild(renderTexture);


// Alternatively, get corresponding sprite and add that
// This is the approach to use from v.1.5.0.0 onwards
renderTexSprite = renderTexture.Sprite;
parentNode.AddChild(renderTexSprite);
</code>
</pre>

So in CocosSharp v1.5.0.0 onwards we have simply removed the ability to add a render texture to a parent node, which is consistent with the role it serves.

* __Attach <code>CCGeometryBatch</code> to scene and rename to <code>CCGeometryNode</code>__. To integrate with our new renderer pipeline, <code>CCGeometryBatch</code> is now derived from <code>CCNode</code> and needs to be attached to a parent node to be renderable. To emphasise this change in behavior, we renamed <code>CCGeometryBatch</code> to <code>CCGeometryNode</code>. Migrating to use <code>CCGeometryNode</code> should be relatively straight-forward. For example

<pre>
<code>
	
// Create node and add to parent
CCGeometryNode geoNode = new CCGeometryNode();
parentNode.AddChild(geoNode);

// Thereafter, setting up drawing geometry should be exactly the same as with CCGeometryBatch

// e.g. Create geom instance with 3 vertices and 3 indices
CCGeometryInstance geomInstance = geoBatch.CreateGeometryInstance(3, 3);

// Populate instance as with CCGeometryBatch


// No need to explicitly flush render commands
// By being added to the scene-graph, rendering is performed implicitly!

</code>
</pre>


* __<code>CCDrawPrimitives</code>__ has now been marked obsolete. Users should instead make use of the pre-existing <code>CCDrawNode</code> class which integrates with the new renderer pipeline, or alternatively use <code>CCGeometryNode</code> to construct more customisable primitives.

* __Effects:__ During the Renderer Pipeline modifications we made changes to all the effects that use a GridBase, examples being <code>CCLiquid</code>, <code>CCShaky</code> etc.  Any of these GridBase effects will need to target a <code>CCNodeGrid</code>.  To do that add the <code>CCNode</code> that will be targeted to an instance of a <code>CCNodeGrid</code>.  This breaking change greatly simplifies the rendering code and our source code base.  Every rendering loop there were checks for Grid usage even when not being used which resulted in unnessasary processing cycles and making the rendering source hard to manage. The following demonstrates how to run an <code>Effect</code> targeting a <code>CCSprite</code> that is wrapped in a <code>CCNodeGrid</code>.

<pre>
<code>

// Define our Effect Action
var fadeOut = new CCFadeOutBLTiles(1f, new CCGridSize(10, 10));

// Create a target CCNodeGrid because the FadeOutBLTiles uses a grid
var targetNode = new CCNodeGrid();
AddChild(targetNode);

// Create our sprite
var sprite = new CCSprite("grosinni");
sprite.Position = this.ContentSize.Center;

// our sprite needs to be wrapped in a CCNodeGrid
targetNode.AddChild(sprite);

// Run the action against the wrapping CCNodeGrid targetNode 
targetNode.RunAction (fadeOut);
</code>
</pre>

* __v.1.4.0.0 reminder__: Usage of the obsolete <code>CCLabelBMFont</code> and <code>CCLabelTtf</code> classes should be replaced with unified label class <code>CCLabel</code> (see [here](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/37873/cocossharp-v1-4-0-0-release)). These obsolete classes will be removed in future releases!
