# CocosSharp v1.4.0.0 release notes

## Breaking changes 
 ---

* Changes to CCLog custom logging interface as described [here](https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp/wiki/Logging)
* Please also see details of Unified labels for future breaking changes

## Key new features
 ---
### Unified labels

The previous support for labels was disjoint and offered inconsistent behaviour across different formats/platforms. Motivated by a desire to do away with these issues, we now offer a single point of control for creating bitmap, sprite and system fonts -- namely, <code>CCLabel</code>, where the desired format is specified within the constructor. For example, 

<pre>
<code>
// CCLabel Sprite Font
var label1 = new CCLabel("Hello SpriteFont", "fonts/arial", 26, CCLabelFormat.SpriteFont);

// CCLabel Bitmap Font - No need to pass a CCLabelFormat because the default for this constructor is BitmapFont
var label2 = new CCLabel("Hello Bitmap Font", "fonts/bitmapFontTest3.fnt");

// CCLabel using the system font Arial
var label3 = new CCLabel("Hello System Font", "Arial", 20, CCLabelFormat.SystemFont);

// CCLabel using the MorrisRoman-Black.ttf font included as content in the fonts folder
var label4 = new CCLabel("Hello MorrisRoman-Black", "fonts/MorrisRoman-Black.ttf", size, CCLabelFormat.SystemFont)
</code>
</pre>

Note, that while the now obsolete <code>CCLabelBMFont</code> and <code>CCLabelTtf</code> classes remain in this release, to avoid confusion, we will aim to remove these classes entirely in subsequent releases. Thus it is recommended that users migrate their existing code-base to use unified labels as soon as possible. 

Further in-depth details on the features of the new unified <code>CCLabel</code> implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp/wiki/Labels).

Also, a special thanks to RenÃ© Ruppert for testing and putting the new labels through their paces!

### Beefed up tile map support

Some great new features for our [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) tile map support including

* support for CSV and xml encoded tile maps
* support for TMX-specified tile animations
* support for staggered isometric tile map types
* a more robust and faster tile-map renderer (tile visibility culling and support for very large tile maps)
